  <summary>create a binary release from source code</summary>
  <description>
0compile creates a binary from source code, either for your own use or ready
for publishing on the web through Zero Install. It works by setting up a
build environment and then executing the (source) interface. The default
source implementation is executed in the following environment:

- Read access to all build dependencies (from the source interface)

- Write access to $TMPDIR (empty, deleted after the build)

- Write access to $BUILDDIR, which is also the current directory (this persists over builds by default, to speed up rebuilds)

- Write access to $DESTDIR (the final binary package and interface)

- No write access anywhere else.

- Read access to $SRCDIR

If plash is not installed, the read-only restrictions are not enforced, but you
should follow them anyway.

As a special case, the source interface may specify compile-type='CMM', in which
case the 'main' attribute gives the location of an autoconf configure script and
the familiar './configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install' sequence
will be run with appropriate options passed to configure to use the correct directories.
