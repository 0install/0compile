Don't be confused by the setup.py... that's for the "0compile setup" subcommand!

If you got this by cloning a GIT repository, register the feed like this:

$ 0launch --feed 0compile.xml

To check this version is selected by default, use:

$ 0launch -g http://0install.net/2006/interfaces/0compile.xml

In the Preferences box ensure "Help test new versions" is enabled.
