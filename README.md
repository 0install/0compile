INTRODUCTION
------------

0compile takes a 0install source implementation and compiles a 0install binary from it.
It can use 0install to fetch the build dependencies (libraries, headers, build
tools and compilers) and can recursively build dependencies from source too.

For more information, see <http://0install.net/0compile.html>.
